Shelly/SIUNL/human.sh/Shell Interaction Using Natural Language
====================================================================

Idea: Andrei Lisnic - human.sh (https://github.com/alisnic/human.sh)

====================================================================

Requirements: bash

Restrictions: currently works on ubuntu. Should work on its derivatives.
            Other distros TBD

Shelly - is an easy to use CLI tool that allows accomplishing work
via Linux terminal (that has bash shell) without necessarily
knowing how things are done in Linux or in this certain Linux
distro. You can just type "shelly install skype" OR "shelly mount MyCD",
etc. And when the ork is done, Shelly will be there to entertain you.
"shelly lets go for a drink", "shelly make me a sandwhich", "shelly I
love you"
