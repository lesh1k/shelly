This thesis covers the design and implementation of a peer-to-peer teaching
network. The primary goals is to use cutting-edge technology in order to create
the social network and to explore unconventional virtual learning techniques.
One of the secondary goals of the system is to make it standard-based, web-only,
and so to make it accessible, and independent of proprietary technology.

In order to make the software more useful, it is released under a Free Software
license, \href{http://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html}{AGPLv3}. The code can
be downloaded from \href{https://gitorious.org/discite/discite/}{Gitorious}, and
used without restrictions by universities or high schools. Deployment scripts
are provided, and so is documentation.

An instance of the application is running at \url{http://discite.info}. The
name of the application, "Discite", means "to learn" in Latin.
