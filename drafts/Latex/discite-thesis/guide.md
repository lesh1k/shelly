 Introduction

    Description of the problem Why you chose to solve this specific problem, ex:
    references to studies that conclude it is very important to handle it you
    were explicitly asked by customers or friends your intuition made you do it,
    etc Overview of existing solutions point out what is wrong with them make it
    clear how your solution makes the world better, by not repeating the
    mistakes of others, or by repeating them better :-)

Requirements

    Include the formal list of requirements for the new system Explain the
    rationale behind each requirement (by making associations with excerpts from
    the studies or people interviews from the previous point)

Design

    Describe how you broke the system down into smaller components
    Explain the role of each component
    And how it interacts with other components

Planning

    Estimated time for the implementation of the project
    Provide estimates for each component
    Explain how the estimates were computed

Interface

    Discuss the interface of your system and the guidelines you've used when
    devising it (ex: be consistent, be simple, less is more, use native widgets,
    etc) Include preliminary sketches, pointing out the role of each widget (by
    making associations with your requirements) Which GUI toolkit you used, why?

Implementation

    What is the language of choice? Why?  Which third-party modules does the
    system rely on?  explain how those modules were chosen (ex: licensing
    conflicts, performance, features, cross-platform compatibility, etc) Which
    storage formats are used? Why?  Which communication protocols are used? Why?
    Which algorithms are used? Why?

Post-release analysis

    Discuss the delta between your estimates and the actual time of development
        try to explain why it happened
        describe how similar problems will be avoided in the future
    Discuss the future of the project
        new features
        expected bugs
        how it can be extended to be applied in other fields, etc.

Conclusion

    Explain how this project makes the world a better place
    Explain how working on this project made you a better person


Combo bonus

While every person develops a generic set of surviving skills (otherwise they're
eaten by lions), some people additionally develop a specific skill, continuously
optimizing it. That's how some of us become archers, melee fighters, dark
magicians or light magicians.

When it comes to specialization within the PSI course, you can choose one of the
following paths:

    Eye candy baker - make a GUI that is very pretty
    Performance wizard - make a project that is designed to run very fast (or
    use very little memory, or has a very small size, etc; choose whatever
    metric you are interested in)
    Usability guru - a project optimized to provide the best user experience
    Ãœberplanner - devise the most detailed and the most consistent specs
    Businessman - create a complete solution, with a manual, a logo and a
    web-presence, ready for the masses
    Scribe - provide comprehensive documentation, employ some unusual methods of
    representing information in a form that is easy to understand
    Xenomorph - create something so unusual, so paradigm-shifting, that you
    could be regarded as the founder of a new field


Specialization gives you bonus points and relaxes the requirements for the other
parts of the project. For example, if your requirements document is very
detailed and well-written (in accordance with the canons we've discussed in
class), you can get the maximum grade even if you did not manage to implement
most of the requirements.

Meta combo bonuses are a certain way to excel in this assignment. For example,
an eye-candy baker who is also a usability guru is automatically promoted to a
+45 godlike level.
Other things that give you extra credit:
Provide references to studies, white-papers, articles or forum discussions that
you relied on when making decisions in your project
