\section{Test-Driven Development}
Test-Driven Development is a software development methodology and strategy that
requires test to written first (the red stage), then write just enough code to
make the tests pass (the green stage), and the analyze the code written, and
change it if necessary (the refactor stage). By necessity we mean either changing
the code for performance reasons, readability, consistency with the rest of the
codebase, or other reasons.
