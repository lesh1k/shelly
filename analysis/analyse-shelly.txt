IDEAS
------------------------------------

- Exisiting solutions,which are these, if there are any, why is SIUNL better, if it is. (betty, pacapt)
    * betty is not pure bash, it's ruby
- Display actual command that is executed (?? possibility to turn off)
- Auto complete
- Benefits from using/installing Shelly
- Support for diff OSes and package managers
    * For software install pacapt might be an option
- Ask if the user is willing to share his history of commands and allows further recording of commands for further improvement of Shelly
- Manual. Documentation and "help" function.
- Option to display all available aliases
- grep, sed, awk
- make a list of repos. add 3rd party software install
- word-distance based analysis. if input has "do I have Python", the answer could be "Python is not installed,
  however, there's python. Maybe that's what you were looking for"


Bells&whistles: 
    
    a) Text coloring and styling
    b) word definitions
    c) do a barrel roll


DONE: 
-------------------------------------

- Determining OS info, hardware platform and available package managers
